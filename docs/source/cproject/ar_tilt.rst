2.6 - Tilt It！
==========================

|img_tilt|

The tilt switch is a 2-pin device with a metal ball in the middle. When you put it upright, the 2 pins are connected together; when you tilt the switch, 2 pins will be disconnected.


**Bill of Materials**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

|sch_tilt|

When you put it upright, GP14 will get high; after tilting it, GP14 will get low.

The purpose of the 10K resistor is to keep the GP14 in a stable low state when the tilt switch is in a tilted state.

After the program runs, when you tilt the breadboard (tilt switch), "The switch works!" will appear in the shell.
