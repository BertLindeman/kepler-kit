2.2 - Display the Level
=============================


The first project is simply to make the LED blink. In this project let's use the LED Bar Graph, which is made up of 10 LEDs packaged into a plastic case, generally used to display power or volume levels.

**Bill of Materials**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

|sch_ledbar|

The LED Bar Graph contains 10 LEDs, each of which is individually controllable. Here, the anode of each of the 10 LEDs is connected to GP6~GP15, and the cathode is connected to a 220ohm resistor, and then to GND.

When the program is running, you will see the LEDs on the LED Bar Graph light up and then turn off in sequence.

**How it works?**

Each of the ten LEDs on the LED Bar needs to be controlled by a pin, which means that we define these ten pins.

The codes in ``setup()`` use the for loop to initialize pins 6~15 to output mode in turn.

.. code-block:: C

    for(int i=6;i<=15;i++)
    {
        pinMode(i,OUTPUT);
    }   

The for loop is used in ``loop()`` to make the LED flash(turn on 0.5s, then turn off 0.5s) in sequence.

.. code-block:: C

    for(int i=6;i<=15;i++)
    {
        digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
        delay(500);
        digitalWrite(i,LOW);
        delay(500);    
    }
